## A Flexible User Configurable NodeJS Web Server

**_By Dave Campbell_**

### Abstract

NodeJS implements server-side JavaScript and supports development of application specific web servers. This code implements a flexible user-configurable web server platform with a number of embellishments over the basic NodeJS examples. These embellishments include, a reverse proxy for handling multiple servers/services on a single IP address, features and services defined by a user-configurable JSON file, and adaptable application based on user specified handlers loaded at startup.

The document *A Flexible User Configurable NodeJS Web Server.docx* and example configuration files provide additional details.

### To Do

- Fix proxy/websocket interaction
- Add GET /user/items to hbAuth.js 
- Build a demo site
